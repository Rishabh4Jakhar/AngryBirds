# Angry-Birds

## Project Description

Made by [Rishabh Jakhar](https://github.com/Rishabh4Jakhar/) and [Advik Gupta](https://github.com/NOVA2OP) as part of the **Advanced Programming 2024 course**.
<br><br>
The game features three levels, three types of birds, three types of pigs, and three types of materials. 
The first two levels are basic, while the third level is still under development. The game also includes dummy buttons to indicate level completion or failure.
