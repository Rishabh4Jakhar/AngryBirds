# Angry-Birds

## Project Description

This project is a replica of the Angry Birds game, developed in **Java using the libGDX framework** for desktop. 
<br>
Made by [Rishabh Jakhar](https://github.com/Rishabh4Jakhar/) and [Advik Gupta](https://github.com/NOVA2OP) as part of the **Advanced Programming 2024 course**.
<br><br>
The game features three levels, three types of birds, three types of pigs, and three types of materials. 
The first two levels are basic, while the third level is still under development. The game also includes dummy buttons to indicate level completion or failure.

- Three birds are created: RedBird, YellowBird, and BlueBird.
- Three pigs are used: normal pig, chief pig, and king pig. 
- Three types of materials are used: wood, ice, and stone. 
- For win/lose screens, dummy buttons are used to show if a level has been completed (green button) or failed (red button) on each level screen.
