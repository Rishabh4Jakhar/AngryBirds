# Angry-Birds

## Project Description

A [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) project generated with [gdx-liftoff](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-liftoff).

This project was generated with a template including simple application launchers and an `ApplicationAdapter` extension that draws libGDX logo.

This is a project created by Advik Gupta and Rishabh Jakhar as a part of major project of course Advanced Programming 2024. This is a replica of AngryBirds game made in java using libGDX.

## Platforms

- `core`: Main module with the application logic shared by all platforms.
- `lwjgl3`: Primary desktop platform using LWJGL3; was called 'desktop' in older docs.

For example, `core:clean` removes `build` folder only from the `core` project.

## Assumptions

1) Made only 3 levels out of which level 1 and level 2 are created in a very basic manner and level 3 is coming soon.
2) 3 birds created; RedBird, YellowBird and BlueBird.
3) 3 pigs used; normal pig, chief pig and king pig.
4) 3 types of materials used; wood, ice and stone.
5) For win/lose screen, we have made dummy buttons to show if level has been completed (green button) or has been failed (red button) on each level screen.
